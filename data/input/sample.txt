Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                   PORTS               NAMES
1ae3b36715d2        ubuntu:latest       "bash"              17 seconds ago      Up 16 seconds (Paused)                       test

$ docker exec test ls

FATA[0000] Error response from daemon: Container test is paused, unpause the container before exec

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.

--detach , -d		Detached mode: run command in the background
--detach-keys		Override the key sequence for detaching a container
--env , -e		API 1.25+
Set environment variables
--interactive , -i		Keep STDIN open even if not attached

--user , -u		Username or UID (format: <name|uid>[:<group|gid>])
--workdir , -w		API 1.35+
Working directory inside the container
Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Parent command
Command	Description
docker	The base command for the Docker CLI.
Extended description
The docker exec command runs a new command in a running container.

The command started using docker exec only runs while the container’s primary process (PID 1) is running, and it is not restarted if the container is restarted.

COMMAND will run in the default directory of the container. If the underlying image has a custom directory specified with the WORKDIR directive in its Dockerfile, this will be used instead.

COMMAND should be an executable, a chained or a quoted command will not work. Example: docker exec -ti my_container "echo a && echo b" will not work, but docker exec -ti my_container sh -c "echo a && echo b" will.

Examples
Run docker exec on a running container
First, start a container.

$ docker run --name ubuntu_bash --rm -i -t ubuntu bash
This will create a container named ubuntu_bash and start a Bash session.

Next, execute a command on the container.

$ docker exec -d ubuntu_bash touch /tmp/execWorks
This will create a new file /tmp/execWorks inside the running container ubuntu_bash, in the background.

Next, execute an interactive bash shell on the container.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash.

Next, set an environment variable in the current bash session.

$ docker exec -it -e VAR=1 ubuntu_bash bash
This will create a new Bash session in the container ubuntu_bash with environment variable $VAR set to “1”. Note that this environment variable will only be valid on the current Bash session.

By default docker exec command runs in the same working directory set when container was created.

$ docker exec -it ubuntu_bash pwd
/
You can select working directory for the command to execute into

$ docker exec -it -w /root ubuntu_bash pwd
/root
Try to run docker exec on a paused container
If the container is paused, then the docker exec command will fail with an error:

$ docker pause test

test

$ docker ps

Docker Enterprise Edition Platform
Estimated reading time: 5 minutes
Docker Enterprise Edition Platform 2.0 (Docker EE) is a Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) platform that enables a secure software supply chain and deploys diverse applications for high availability across disparate infrastructure, both on-premises and in the cloud.

Docker Enterprise Edition is a secure, scalable, and supported container platform for building and orchestrating applications across multi-tenant Linux, Windows Server 2016, and IBM z Systems environments.

Docker EE enables deploying your workloads for high availability (HA) onto the orchestrator of your choice. Docker EE automates many of the tasks that orchestration requires, like provisioning pods, containers, and cluster resources. Self-healing components ensure that Docker EE clusters remain highly available.

Role-based access control applies to Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrators, and communication within the cluster is secured with TLS. Docker Content Trust is enforced for images on all of the orchestrators.

Docker EE Platform includes Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), the enterprise-grade cluster management solution from Docker. You install it on-premises or in your virtual private cloud, and it helps you manage your cluster and applications through a single interface.



Docker Enterprise Edition features
Docker EE Platform provides multi-architecture orchestration for Kubernetes and Swarm workloads. Docker EE enables a secure software supply chain, with image promotion, mirroring between registries, and signing/scanning enforcement for Kubernetes images.

Kubernetes support
Kubernetes in Docker EE fully supports all Docker EE features, including role-based access control, LDAP/AD integration, scanning, signing enforcement, and security policies.

Kubernetes features on Docker EE include:

Kubernetes orchestration full feature set
CNCF Certified Kubernetes conformance
Kubernetes app deployment by using web UI or CLI
Compose stack deployment for Swarm and Kubernetes apps
Role-based access control for Kubernetes workloads
Pod-based autoscaling, to increase and decrease pod count based on CPU usage
Blue-Green deployments, for load balancing to different app versions
Ingress Controllers with Kubernetes L7 routing
Interoperability between Swarm and Kubernetes workloads for networking and storage
In addition, UCP integrates with Kubernetes by using admission controllers, which enable:

Authenticating user client bundle certificates when communicating directly with the Kubernetes API server
Authorizing requests via the UCP role-based access control model
Assigning nodes to a namespace by injecting a NodeSelector automatically to workloads via admission control
Keeping all nodes in both Kubernetes and Swarm orchestrator inventories
Fine-grained access control and privilege escalation prevention without the PodSecurityPolicy admission controller
Resolving images of deployed workloads automatically, and accepting or rejecting images based on UCP’s signing-policy feature
The default Docker EE installation includes both Kubernetes and Swarm components across the cluster, so every newly joined worker node is ready to schedule Kubernetes or Swarm workloads.

IBM z Systems

Kubernetes workloads aren’t supported on IBM z Systems clusters. On a mixed cluster with z Systems, Docker EE won’t schedule Kubernetes workloads on z Systems nodes.

Orchestration platform features


Docker EE manager nodes are both Swarm managers and Kubernetes masters, to enable high availability
Allocate nodes for Swarm and Kubernetes workloads
Single pane of glass for monitoring apps
Enhanced Swarm hostname routing mesh with Interlock 2.0
One platform-wide management plane: secure software supply chain, secure multi-tenancy, and secure and highly available node management
Secure supply chain


Image signing and scanning of Kubernetes apps for validating and verifying content
Image promotion with mirroring between registries
Define policies for automating image promotions across the app development lifecycle of Kubernetes apps
Centralized cluster management
With Docker, you can join up to thousands of physical or virtual machines together to create a container cluster, allowing you to deploy your applications at scale. Docker EE extends the functionality provided by Docker Engine to make it easier to manage your cluster from a centralized place.

You can manage and monitor your container cluster using a graphical web UI.

Deploy, manage, and monitor
With Docker EE, you can manage from a centralized place all of the computing resources you have available, like nodes, volumes, and networks.

You can also deploy and monitor your applications and services.

Built-in security and access control
Docker EE has its own built-in authentication mechanism with role-based access control (RBAC), so that you can control who can access and make changes to your swarm and applications. Also, Docker EE authentication integrates with LDAP services. Learn about role-based access control.



Docker EE integrates with Docker Trusted Registry so that you can keep the Docker images you use for your applications behind your firewall, where they are safe and can’t be tampered with.

You can also enforce security policies and only allow running applications that use Docker images you know and trust.

Docker EE and the CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Docker API, so you can continue using the tools that you already know, including the Docker CLI client, to deploy and manage your applications.

For example, you can use the docker info command to check the status of a Swarm managed by Docker EE:

docker info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Containers: 38
Running: 23
Paused: 0
Stopped: 15
Images: 17
Server Version: 17.06
...
Swarm: active
NodeID: ocpv7el0uz8g9q7dmw8ay4yps
Is Manager: true
ClusterID: tylpv1kxjtgoik2jnrg8pvkg6
Managers: 1
…
Use the Kubernetes CLI
Docker EE exposes the standard Kubernetes API, and it installs the command-line tool, kubectl, by default, so you can use the usual Kubernetes commands, like kubectl cluster-info:

kubectl cluster-info
Which produces output similar to the following:

Kubernetes master is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://54.200.115.43:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
